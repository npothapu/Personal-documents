Elevating The Voices of Tomorrow

TeenVoice, a wholly owned for-profit subsidiary of national nonprofit American Student Assistance, gives teens and young adults a platform to voice their opinions and preferences while providing teen-centric organizations with a quick and intuitive way to gain deep market research insights on their target audience.

Why TeenVoice?

Bridging The Gap

Teen market research recruitment is typically time-consuming, inefficient, and expensive. Because we’ve mastered engaging them on their terms, we’re able to connect you with this notoriously hard-to-reach demographic. No static lists or unreliable panels—TeenVoice connects you with this proprietary, always-on teen audience to help you make informed decisions.

Trusted By Teens

Daily, tens of thousands of teens are using our product EvolveMe, incentivized by a points-based rewards system to build life skills and plan for their futures after high school.

Understanding The Future They Want to See

TeenVoice enables organizations to tap into genuine Gen Z insights while giving young people the ability to actively take part in shaping the world around them.

Our Beliefs

Teens should have a voice in designing the world they are going to inherit

They should be at the center of informing decisions that will impact their lives and future.

Learning from teens is harder than it should be

Recruiting and engaging them is typically time consuming, inefficient and expensive.

How you communicate with teens matters

TeenVoice engages with teens on their terms, in an environment where they’re already learning and exploring.

Our Team

From insight analysts to market research consultants, our team has the expertise you need to get started.
