Amidst the challenges faced by mastectomy patients, Ford, a global leader in automotive safety and sustainability, recognized a unique opportunity to make a meaningful impact. One in eight women will encounter breast cancer in their lifetime, with over 100,000 undergoing mastectomies annually. Post-surgery, many struggle with wearing seat belts properly, a crucial safety concern that Ford endeavored to address through innovation and compassion.
