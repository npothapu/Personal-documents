simple architecture for qa to make automation QA ci/cd with github and seleniume bootstrap website developed using Adobe AEM
ChatGPT said:
For a QA Automation CI/CD pipeline for a Selenium-based automation suite testing a Bootstrap website developed in Adobe AEM, here’s a simple architecture:

1. CI/CD Workflow Overview
Trigger: Code changes in AEM or Automation scripts
Build & Test: Run Selenium tests using GitHub Actions
Report & Deploy: Generate reports, notify teams, and deploy if tests pass
2. Architecture Components
A. Source Code Management
GitHub Repository
Stores Selenium test scripts (Java, Python, or JS)
Manages AEM component updates
GitHub Actions for CI/CD
B. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
Triggers:
Pushes to main or qa branch
Scheduled test runs
Jobs:
Set up environment (Java, Node.js, Python, dependencies)
Run Selenium tests (Chrome, Firefox)
Generate reports (Allure, Extent Reports)
Send notifications (Slack, Email)
C. Test Execution
Selenium WebDriver
Runs UI automation tests on the Bootstrap-based AEM website
TestNG / JUnit / PyTest (depending on language)
Organizes test cases
Headless Mode for CI
Chrome / Firefox headless execution
Cross-Browser Testing
Optional: Use BrowserStack or Selenium Grid
D. Reporting & Notifications
Test Reports
Allure Reports for UI test results
Extent Reports (for detailed HTML reports)
Notifications
GitHub Actions alerts
Slack/email notifications for failures
E. AEM Deployment (Optional)
Adobe Cloud Manager or Manual Deploy
If needed, deploy AEM changes after tests pass
3. GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow Example
Here’s a sample .github/workflows/qa-tests.yml to automate Selenium tests:

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Selenium Automation CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - qa
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 3 * * *'  # Runs daily at 3 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger option

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: '11'

    - name: Set up Chrome & WebDriver
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y google-chrome-stable
        CHROME_VERSION=$(google-chrome --version | awk '{print $3}')
        curl -sS -o chromedriver.zip "https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/$(curl -sS https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/LATEST_RELEASE)/chromedriver_linux64.zip"
        unzip chromedriver.zip
        sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
        chromedriver --version

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: mvn install  # Or 'pip install -r requirements.txt' for Python

    - name: Run Selenium Tests
      run: mvn test  # Replace with your test command

    - name: Upload Test Reports
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: test-reports
        path: target/surefire-reports/  # Change based on framework

    - name: Notify on Failure
      if: failure()
      run: |
        curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"QA Tests Failed! ?? Check Reports: $GITHUB_SERVER_URL/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/actions"}' ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
4. Optional Enhancements
Parallel Execution: Use Selenium Grid or Sauce Labs for parallel tests
Performance Testing: Use JMeter or Lighthouse integration
API Testing: Include Postman or REST Assured tests
Accessibility Testing: Add Axe or Lighthouse scans

Here’s an enhanced architecture for your Automation QA CI/CD pipeline with Docker support, Selenium Grid, and Adobe Cloud Manager deployment.

Enhanced CI/CD Architecture for QA Automation
1?? Key Components
? GitHub Actions CI/CD – Automates build, test, and deployment
? Dockerized Selenium Grid – Scalable cross-browser testing
? Adobe Cloud Manager (AEM Deployment) – Deploys AEM updates
? Test Reporting & Notifications – Integrates Allure, Slack, and email alerts

2?? Architecture Overview
A. Source Code Management (GitHub)
Automation repo: Stores Selenium test scripts (Java/Python/JS)
AEM repo: Contains website source code and Adobe Cloud Manager pipeline
GitHub Actions: Triggers tests on PRs, commits, or schedules
B. CI/CD Pipeline Flow
1?? Trigger: Code commit or PR to qa or main
2?? Test Execution:

Set up environment
Run tests in Dockerized Selenium Grid
Capture screenshots & logs
3?? Reporting: Generate Allure/Extent reports
4?? Notification: Send Slack/email alerts on failure
5?? AEM Deployment: Trigger Adobe Cloud Manager if tests pass
3?? CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
Below is a GitHub Actions workflow YAML file implementing:

Dockerized Selenium Grid
Cross-browser testing
AEM Deployment via Adobe Cloud Manager API
Step 1: GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow
Create .github/workflows/qa-automation.yml in your repo:

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: QA Automation CI/CD with Selenium Grid & AEM

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - qa
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - qa
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Run daily at 2 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger

jobs:
  selenium-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      selenium-grid:
        image: selenium/standalone-chrome
        ports:
          - 4444:4444

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: '11'

    - name: Start Selenium Grid
      run: |
        docker-compose up -d

    - name: Install Dependencies

        name: test-reports
        path: target/allure-results/

    - name: Notify on Failure
      if: failure()
      run: |
        curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"QA Tests Failed ?? Check Reports: $GITHUB_SERVER_URL/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/actions"}' ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}

  deploy-aem:
    needs: selenium-tests
