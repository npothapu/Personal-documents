Here’s a CI/CD architecture for QA Automation using Playwright instead of Selenium, with Docker, GitHub Actions, and Adobe AEM deployment.

1?? CI/CD Architecture Overview
? GitHub Actions CI/CD – Automates test execution & deployment
? Playwright with Docker – Cross-browser UI testing
? Adobe Cloud Manager (AEM Deployment) – Deploy AEM updates
? Test Reporting & Notifications – Integrates Allure, Slack, and email alerts

2?? Architecture Components
A. Source Code Management (GitHub)
Automation repo – Stores Playwright test scripts
AEM repo – Contains website source code & Adobe Cloud Manager pipeline
GitHub Actions – Triggers Playwright tests on PRs, commits, or schedules
B. CI/CD Pipeline Flow
1?? Trigger: Code commit or PR to qa or main
2?? Test Execution:

Run Playwright tests in Docker
Capture screenshots & videos
3?? Reporting: Generate Allure/HTML reports
4?? Notification: Send Slack/email alerts on failure
5?? AEM Deployment: Trigger Adobe Cloud Manager if tests pass
3?? CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
Below is a GitHub Actions workflow YAML file implementing:

Playwright in Docker
Cross-browser testing
AEM Deployment via Adobe Cloud Manager API
Step 1: GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow
Create .github/workflows/qa-playwright.yml in your repo:

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Playwright Automation CI/CD with AEM

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - qa
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - qa
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 3 * * *'  # Run daily at 3 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger option

jobs:
  playwright-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm ci  # Ensures clean install based on package-lock.json

    - name: Install Playwright Browsers
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps

    - name: Run Playwright Tests
      run: npx playwright test --reporter=allure

    - name: Upload Playwright Test Reports
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: playwright-test-reports
        path: playwright-report/

    - name: Notify on Failure
      if: failure()
      run: |
        curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"Playwright Tests Failed ?? Check Reports: $GITHUB_SERVER_URL/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/actions"}' ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}

  deploy-aem:
    needs: playwright-tests
    if: success()
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout AEM Repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        repository: my-org/aem-project  # Update with your AEM repo

    - name: Deploy to AEM via Cloud Manager
      run: |
        curl -X POST "https://cloudmanager.adobe.io/api/programs/{PROGRAM_ID}/pipelines/{PIPELINE_ID}/execution" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.AEM_ACCESS_TOKEN }}" \
        -H "x-api-key: ${{ secrets.AEM_API_KEY }}" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json"
Step 2: Dockerized Playwright Setup
You can use Playwright’s official Docker image for running tests in headless mode.

A. Local Playwright Testing with Docker
Create a docker-compose.yml file:

yaml
Copy
Edit
version: "3"
services:
  playwright:
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0-focal
    container_name: playwright-tests
    volumes:
      - .:/tests
    working_dir: /tests
    command: ["npx", "playwright", "test"]
To run tests in Docker:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up --exit-code-from playwright
B. Running Playwright in GitHub Actions with Docker
Modify the GitHub Actions file to use Docker:

yaml
Copy
Edit
    - name: Run Playwright Tests in Docker
      run: |
        docker run --rm -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0-focal npx playwright test
4?? Explanation & Enhancements

Create tests/mobile-navigation.spec.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Mobile Navigation', () => {
  test.use({ viewport: { width: 375, height: 812 } });

  test('should load mobile site correctly', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/');
    const menuButton = page.locator('.hamburger-menu');
    await expect(menuButton).toBeVisible();
    await menuButton.click();
    await expect(page.locator('.mobile-nav')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
Run Mobile Tests
sh
Copy
Edit
npx playwright test --project="Mobile Chrome"
npx playwright test --project="Mobile Safari"
??? 3?? API Testing with Playwright
?? Example Test: API Health Check

ts
Copy
Edit
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('API should return 200', async ({ request }) => {
  const response = await request.get('/api/v1/status');
  expect(response.status()).toBe(200);
  const responseBody = await response.json();
  expect(responseBody.status).toBe('ok');
});
?? Example Test: User Authentication API
Create tests/api-auth.spec.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
test('User login API should return token', async ({ request }) => {
